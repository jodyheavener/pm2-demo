# pm2-demo

This is just a really basic PM2 setup to help demonstrate the capabilities of [PM2 DevTools](https://github.com/jodyheavener/pm2-devtools). It also uses [pm2-ws](https://github.com/jodyheavener/pm2-ws) under the hood.

## Usage

1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14.5.1 was used to develop, but any should be fine) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
2. Clone this repository, `git clone git@github.com:jodyheavener/pm2-demo.git`
3. Install dependencies, `yarn install`
4. Start the PM2 process, `yarn start`
5. Open PM2 DevTools and click, confirm the WebSocket connection, and press the Play button in the bottom left to start outputting logs
